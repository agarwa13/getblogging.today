                <h1>Earnings Disclaimer</h1>

                <h3>Get Blogging Today is a business.</h3>

                <p>We often recommend that our readers use paid tools, services and products. More often than not, we are compensated when a reader purchases one of those tools. This is called affiliate marketing and itâ€™s the main revenue source for Get Blogging Today.</p>

                <h3>
                    The Price You Pay
                </h3>

                <p>When we recommend that you use a tool, we make sure that the price you pay is exactly the same as it would be if we were not compensated. In fact, at times, we can secure a BETTER deal for you, if you go through our links. While these purchases will be delivered at no additional cost to you, we understand if you do not want to use our affiliate links and therefore give us affiliate commissions. Feel free to use any information that you find useful on this site. We sincerely hope that we can help you out.</p>

                <h3>Our Philosophy On Recommending Products</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>We have used every single product that we recommend.</li>
                <li>We thoroughly research competing products before making a recommendation</li>
                <li>Affiliate commissions do not influence our recommendations</li>
                <li>If you believe you have a better product than the one we recommend, prove it and we will update our recommendation.</li>
                </ul>
