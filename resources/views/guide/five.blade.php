                    Armed with a well-setup blog and the WordPress knowledge from the last lesson, you are ready to start blogging. As you do, let me share some advice and a few resources that will be useful to you.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Write Articles Regularly
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Now that you know the in's and out's of WordPress, its time to setup a battle rhythm. The #1 reason most blogs fail is because they do not publish content regularly. Neil Patel is a widely respected blogger and he talks about how you can do this in his blog post titled <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/create-editorial-calendar/" target="_blank">how to create an editorial calendar</a>. I highly recommend that you follow his detailed tutorial.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Create a Mailing List
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A mailing list can help you keep in touch with people who read your blog. It allows you to contact them when you publish a new blog post or when you want to promote something. Especially if you are seeking to make money from your blog, I highly recommend creating a mailing list.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://mbsy.co/convertkit/24701952">ConvertKit</a> is the best mailing list solution for bloggers. The main reasons I like convert kit is that is is easy to use, even for begineers. Also, they have a feature called tagging that becomes very useful if you have multiple ways of collecting their email address.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you want to accelerate the growth of your mailing list, Melyssa Griffin has created an excellent course, <a target="_blank" href="https://melyssagriffin.samcart.com/referral/JZcDSDcc/702487">List Surge</a>, that shows you how to grow your list. It covers a variety of strategies to grow your list including Pinterest, Webinars, Guest Posting, Content Upgrades and more.

                <h3>
                    Marketing is important
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The most challenging part (and the reason many bloggers give up) is because they are unable to attract readers to their blog. The art and science of getting people to your blog is marketing. Therefore, for each hour you spend writing an article, you should spend one hour marketing your blog.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are many different ways to market your blog. Pinterest, LinkedIn, Facebook, Google Search are all widely used platforms that you can use to market your blog, to help people find your blog. However, it isn't easy. To stand out, you need to learn from a successful blogger, how to leverage a particular platform and optimize your strategy to attract the most people.
