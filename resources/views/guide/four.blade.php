                <h3>
                    <a href="#add-posts" data-toggle="collapse" aria-controls="#add-posts">
                        Add Posts

                        In this video, you will learn how to add posts to your blog. Posts (a.k.a. articles / blog posts) are shown in reverse chronological order (i.e. newest ones first) on your blog. Visitors can browse through and read your blog posts.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We add some blog posts to our blog before styling it so that we can see how our blog will look like.  Styling your blog post before creating blog posts means you are styling an empty website. In this case, you will not be able to visualize how your blog might look.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Follow the video below to learn how to add blog posts to your blog and don't worry if you don't have any articles written for your blog already. The video will show you some example content that you can use until you have actual articles written.

                        Add Pages

                    <p>
                        The process of creating pages is similar to that of creating blog posts. However, pages are not articles. Instead, they are used to show information like your contact information or an about me page.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Typically, blogs have a few pages linked to in the primary navigation menu. Let's add these pages now. You can always update the content of these pages later.
                    </p>

                    <img src="#" class="img-responsive" alt="Image of Pages Linked to in the Navigation Menu">

                    <p>
                        Follow this video to create pages on your blog.

                        In this step, we will transform how your blog looks. Because WordPress is so popular, thousands of developers have created themes for WordPress. A theme determines how your blog looks. In this video, I will show you how you can search and apply a free theme to your blog.

                        The navigation menu is the first thing users see when they visit your blog. In this lesson, we learn how you can add, rearrange and remove links from the navigation menu.

                <div class="collapse" id="edit-sidebar">
                    <p>
                        Most themes use a sidebar. Blogs commonly include links to social media sites, the author's photo, a little blurb about the other among other items in the sidebar. In this lesson, we will learn how to add these items to our sidebar.

                    <p>
                        Some themes use a footer. Editing a footer is typically very similar to editing a sidebar and you may not even need this lesson. However, for the sake of completeness, in this lesson, we will learn how to edit the footer.

                        So far we have discussed free themes. You may not be able to achieve the 'look' and 'feel' you desire for your blog using free themes. In this case, you may want to use a premium theme.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        There is a wide range of premium themes out there. In the first video, I show you some of the options you have for premium themes.

                        In this lesson, I dive deeper into one of my favorite premium themes (Divi by Elegant Themes). I demonstrate the power and flexibility of the Divi theme.
